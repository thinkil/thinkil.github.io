<div class="header">About Us</div>
<div class="btext">Think Illinois is a student organization that allows students of all backgrounds to brainstorm, create, and foster new ideas and innovations. At bi-weekly meetings, students explore different topics and solve problems within these fields. To accomplish this, members break off into small, academically diverse groups in order to generate and discuss solutions. Meetings conclude when small groups rejoin to present their ideas. Members are encouraged to pursue these concepts and designs outside of meetings. In addition to general meetings, Think Illinois hosts student mini-lectures, discussions, workshops, and social events.</div>
